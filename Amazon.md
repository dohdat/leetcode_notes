# Leadership Principles

### Customer Obsession
I noticed that several customers were consistently facing challenges with the ITSI rules engine, leading to frustration and downtime. Recognizing the importance of customer satisfaction, I decided to take proactive steps to address these issues.

First, I gathered detailed feedback from the affected customers through support tickets, direct interviews, and surveys. This helped me identify the common pain points and recurring problems. One major issue was the complexity of configuring the rules engine, which required significant manual effort and deep technical knowledge.

To solve this, I initiated a project to simplify the configuration process. I proposed and led the development of a new user-friendly interface with guided steps and automated checks, significantly reducing the setup time and minimizing errors. I collaborated closely with the UX team to ensure the interface was intuitive and aligned with customer needs.

Throughout the development process, I maintained regular communication with the customers who had reported issues. I provided them with updates, sought their feedback on prototypes, and incorporated their suggestions into the final design. This not only improved the solution but also made customers feel valued and heard.

Once the new interface was deployed, I continued to monitor customer feedback and system performance. The results were remarkable: customer satisfaction scores increased, the number of support tickets related to the rules engine dropped by 40%, and the time to configure ITSI was reduced by 60%.

By focusing on the customers' needs, actively seeking their input, and delivering a solution that significantly improved their experience, I exemplified Amazon's "Customer Obsession" principle.
